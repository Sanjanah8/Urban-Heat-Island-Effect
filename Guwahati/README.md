Our project, Greenscape Mapper, aims to combat the growing Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect by mapping heat hotspots and suggesting strategic green cover solutions. This initiative leverages GIS mapping to identify areas with intense heat and proposes interventions such as planting carbon-absorbing trees, establishing vertical gardens, and installing white roofs to mitigate excessive urban heat.

Our initial implementation focuses on Guwahati, a city in India experiencing the UHI effect, utilizing its environmental datasets to highlight vulnerable zones. However, Green scape Mapper is designed to scale globally, targeting cities around the world facing similar heat challenges. The next phase involves integrating more datasets from cities in other countries, expanding its scope to make impactful, data-driven recommendations for climate resilience.

This project addresses a crucial global challenge urban heat by offering actionable, sustainable solutions to cool cities and reduce the harmful effects of climate change. The significance of this tool lies in its holistic approach, combining technology, data analysis, and environmental science to protect urban environments and enhance livability for future generations.
